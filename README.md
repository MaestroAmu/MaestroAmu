I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer with an impetuous passion for technology. I'm involved in a consortium of technologies that enable me to develop and deploy applications on the web in a secure and accessible manner. I'd love to integrate my enthusiasm, software, and cloud engineering skillset to improve man's way of life and hopefully make the world a better place one code at a time.
